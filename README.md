# Inverted_Index_Creation
 
For the full, detailed project description, please take a look at Project_Description.pdf. To run the project, all the necessary files are UnigramIndex.java, BigramIndex.java, data folder, and lib folder. Note: the project was developed in IntelliJ coding environment (it may be best to use this for optimal performance). Moreover, UnigramIndex.java is a separate from Bigram.java, thus one must edit the configurations for each class (e.g. set the command line argument for UnigramIndex class to be "data/fulldata output_unigram"). Click run (green play button) after setting configurations.

**Synopsis**: In this project, we write code to create a unigram index and a bigram index, i.e. code that indexes words from multiple text files (files exist in "data" folder), and outputs an inverted index that looks like what is shown in both unigram_index.txt and selected_bigram_index.txt. The input data in the data folder is already cleaned, e.g. \n and \r characters. However, \t character exists between the document ID and the document text (taken care of in the code in map method). In other words, the input files are in a key-value format where docID is the key, and the contents are the value; the key and value are separated by a tab. After running UnigramIndex.java and BigramIndex.java, unigram_index.txt and selected_bigram_index.txt are created respectively.
